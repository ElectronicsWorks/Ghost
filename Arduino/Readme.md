# Arduino code

### Isolated sketches for testing

Most of the code in this directory are small Arduino sketches focused on just testing and verifying one particular piece of the puzzle. There is one for the IR sensors, one for the motors, one for the startmodule etc. This makes it easy to validate that a particular piece of hardware works.

### Main program

The code in the Ghost folder is the main program for the RC car. It contains the full program for running the RC car.

### Path planning

Middle Path (MP) and Minimum Curvature Path (MCP) - see http://www.aueb.gr/users/ion/docs/stavrinos_bsc_thesis.pdf
